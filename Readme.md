🔨 How It Works
1️⃣ Enter a Prompt
Tell Flash what you want (e.g., “build a landing page for a SaaS product”). The AI generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup for you.

2️⃣ Customize with the Code Editor
Open the integrated editor to fine-tune your design, modify content, or add new features.

3️⃣ Live Preview
See instant updates in the browser as you code — no need for refreshing or external tools.

4️⃣ Publish Your Website
When you’re happy with the result, publish it straight from Flash, or download the entire project to deploy it yourself.

🚀 Why Flash?
✨ For Creatives: Skip the technical overhead and focus on design and content.
✨ For Developers: Rapidly prototype ideas and save time on boilerplate setups.
✨ For Startups: Launch MVPs faster without worrying about infrastructure.
